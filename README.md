# Project Cele (Working Title)
Simple music player for Windows 7, made in Aero aesthetic.
Supports only .mp3 (for now).
# Requirements
1. A PC with Windows XP SP2+/Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2+, Windows Vista Starter isn't supported.
2. Installed .NET Framework 4.0+
# How to build?
1. Download Visual Studio 2010 on Your computer
2. Open the .sln file
3. Here you are! Select Build > Release
# Here's what you can do:
Drag-and-Drop .mp3s (PATCH 1.5 ONLY), Edit Artists (year, photo), Edit Albums (type, cover, artist, year), Hide and Merge artists, save all of the changes (it saves even after updating or replacing .exe!) and many more.
# The Preferism System (Beta)
The Preferism is kinda like a recommendation algorytm - on Artist and Album pages you can click on "Prefer", this buffs up these songs for 10% more chance when shuffling all of the tracks. This system can be removed in About section. Right now me and juzadss are looking into making, like, Spotify Radios? But it probably will be kinda hard to do.
